                    <h3>THE PHILOSOPHY</h3>

                    <h3>A Statement of PRINCIPLES OF CARE</h3>
                    <p>Residents of  St Margarets  are entitled not only to professional care, but to holistic care encompassing their emotional, spiritual and psychological requirements. Residential care is tailored to each resident’s individual needs, and is not for convenience of delivery by the staff.  </p>
                    <p>Every resident is entitled to the same rights they would expect in their own home.  Promoting independence and personal choice is vital, even if it involves an element of risk taking; although we do our best to minimize risks, the resident’s personal preferences remain paramount.  </p>
                    <p><un>
                       <li>All staff endeavors to ensure that every resident is treated with dignity and respect, and that privacy is maintained, regardless of physical or mental disability.  </li>
                       <li>Residents are known by their preferred form of address, either their forename or title, as they request.</li>
                       <li>Staffs knock and wait for permission before entering a resident’s room.</li>
                       <li>Staffs afford every resident the maximum of privacy and discretion when assisting with their personal and medical needs.
                       Staff may not discuss the private affairs of any resident with a third party, nor offer comment or opinion on any matter relating to their work</li>
                   </un></p>
                   <p><b>St Margarets</b>  aims to provide its Service Users with a secure, relaxed and homely environment in which their care, well-being and comfort are of prime importance.
                    Our Care staff will strive to preserve and maintain the dignity, individuality, and privacy of all Service Users within a warm and caring atmosphere, and in doing so will be sensitive to the Service Users ever changing needs. Such needs maybe medical or therapeutic (for physical and mental welfare), cultural, psychological, spiritual, emotional and social, and service users are encouraged to participate in the development of their individualized Care Plans in which the involvement of family and friends maybe appropriate and is greatly valued.
                    This will be achieved through program of activities designed to encourage mental alertness, self-esteem, social interaction with other Service Users and with recognition of the following core values of care that are fundamental to the philosophy of our Home:
                </p>
                <p><b>PRIVACY</b>: The right of a Service User to be left alone and undisturbed whenever they wish.
                    <b>DIGNITY</b>: To understand the Service User’s needs and treat them with respect.
                    <b>CHOICE</b>: Give a Service User the opportunity to select for themselves from a range of alternative options.
                    <b>RIGHTS</b>: Keep all basic human rights available to the Service User.
                    <b>FULFILMENT</b>: Enable the Service User to realize their own aims and help them to achieve these goals in all aspects of daily living
                </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
